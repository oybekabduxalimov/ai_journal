        <h2>About Decision Journal</h2>
  
        <p>
          This project helps you think better about your plans by turning them
          into structured decisions and receiving AI-powered feedback.
        </p>
  
        <h3>How to use it effectively</h3>
  
        <ul>
          <li>Write plans honestly, not perfectly</li>
          <li>Explain your reasons clearly</li>
          <li>Use AI feedback as a second perspective, not authority</li>
          <li>Iterate: refine plans instead of deleting them</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>About the creator</h3>
  
        <p>
          Built by Oybek Abdukhalimov, a full-stack ML-focused engineer for learning and portfolio
          project to explore decision intelligence systems.
